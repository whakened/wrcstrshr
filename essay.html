                </div>
                <p>Hello  !!!   i  Type  Kind of like a  Actual Fucking Psychopath.  You . Might have wondered Why i type as such . ??? maybe ??? Perhaps ???</p>
                <p>Anyways   Im . Going to Write this as i would Type Normally  so that you can . Maybe try to  Figure out how    I     ,, felt  while Typing this . Fun Challenge</p>
                <br>
                <p>So To Start Off With . Why do I type like This !?</p>
                <p>i Used to type in a Similar Manner as i do Now  however it was Without Any Real Purpose .  I would not be picky about Capitalization  and punctuation had No meaning regardless of Where it was . Something from 2019 might have looked like :</p>
                <p><span style="color: #aaa;">h;'Ello  thi.s i san e.;xam[ple sente.nce'</span></p>
                <p>while it Looks Somewhat similar to how i type Now ,  it is . Drastically Different . I No Longer interrupt Words as such and i Do not use half of those Characters without Reason anymore .</p>
                <br>
                <p>. Following this , around 2020 or Maybe 2021 , i attached Arbitrary Meanings to Individual Letters . i Do not fully recall these , although i know i would Often use 'h' as a Sigh , 'j' as Filler , and 'r' as Some sort of like . Judgement thing . If that Makes Sense .</p>
