I believe i just Do not like the idea of that information being so Readily Accessible here . it Feels off . also Vocally i present myself Differently very often ; i Do not really know why . i have not recognized any pattern so i think it might Genuinely just be Random ?? Idk . i do not fully understand this yet</p>

            <p>Here's some shit that I do or Have done . I was Going to title this section something like "projects, connections, relations" but it was Too Long . also thats a Stupid fucking name</p>
            <p>also i promise i'll made this section look nicer later i just Really Dont Wanna ....</p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>i have worked with programming for a While !! maybe like 7 or 8 years by now ?? idk! im Awful at it though so i Might as well have 1 Real year of experience</p>
            <p>usually i revolve around game development However i lack the ability to Actually Follow Through with anything i make . this leaves me with shit that is Hardly Playable . at the time of writing , i have Not made anything in long enough that i currently am Unable to convince myself to Start anything . Unfortunate , but Whatever !</p>
            <h3>The NEAT Project</h3>
            <p>ironically , the Main thing anyone knows me for is This . i Originally started it on roblox in June of 2019 . i Myself stopped working on it probably a year or two in ( due to Similar reasons as listed above and Probably More) however Despite this , it still survives . i am Uncertain how to Stop distancing from it . objectively as many have pointed out , me Leaving would be Very beneficial . i do not agree with this . i doubt that would make Sense to anyone else but Whatever !!</p>
            <p>while i have made Several minor attempts to Reintegrate myself with it , none have been successful . it is Not a system i can participate in given its current state</p>
            <h3>Actual Gamedev</h3>
            <p>im Awful at this and therefore do Not make games often . i also find it Very Difficult to think of any ideas to work with for gamedev . maybe i will make my Next game in 2054 .</p>
            <h3>Random Shit</h3>
            <p>i Love making random shit . such a pure joy . i used to program games on calculators Simply because it was possible and i wanted to . unfortunately i suffer the same problem mentioned just above regarding This as well . Zero ideas therefore No Making</p>
            <h3>This Website</h3>
            <p>idk Why i made this website originally but  Whatever i have it now so Might As Well Use It !! i've decided to use it to just talk about Whatever the fuck i want to . Sure  probably Nobody cares about most anything i will ever Write here , but Thats okay ! i much prefer speaking my mind to a machine over not speaking it to anyone or anything .</p>
        </div>
        <div class="inl-b full custom-spacing">
            <p>Trying to or wish to talk with me? Consider The Following .</p>
            <p>i am . Not easy to talk with !! i understand this !! please be Clear when speaking with me .</p>
            <p>also NO i will NEVER message first unless it is Absolutely Necessary i do . i Strictly am NOT allowed to message first . it is Deeply terrifying to me</p>
            <p>however ! despite these, I fucking love talking with people!! doesn't have to be anything important, almost anything will get my attention.</p>
            <p hidden>No Like Seriously Please Talk To Me . I Beg . i need an inhuman amount of attention</p>
