                <p><span class="fancy-text">w</span>. I'm w. Formerly worcestershire sauce, even more-so formerly whakened. I came up with the original username maybe around 2016, and it was created by me just.. hitting my keyboard, and then adding vowels so it can be said. In late 2019, I found myself as worcestershire sauce as I had been shuffling through food items as a joke; and then never found anything to replace it. It stuck, and remained until 2024, where I now just call myself w.</p>

                <p>I decided to call myself w as it was very simple; it's not confusing, it's easy to type, and it just looks nice. I never directly decided this, however; I just shortened it as a joke and then it stuck, much like worcestershire sauce had stuck. You'll most often see me still using one of my previous usernames, although if you refer to me by just w, it would be appreciated.</p>

                <p>"What" as in like, what do I do. Not enough room up there for that though. Anyways. I do a lot of shit, but nothing consistently. Primarily I just make games or random programs, of which some can be found on this website. As of recently, music as well, using FamiTracker. I find the constraints there to be entertaining to work with and around. I also just really don't want to have to learn something like FL Studio, I'm not smart enough for that.</p>

                <p>Me? Myself? I don't know. Assuming you don't know me in person, you'll have to figure out most about me by talking to me. I'm typically very open to questions, but I am against publicly detailing myself here. What I'll start you off with is that I am a male, so he/him for those concerned. I prefer being referred to as w, although I am fine being referred to normally.</p>

                <p>Brief  Description !! #4 I think</p>
                <p>okay so  like  this is  . Technical death metal . from 1996 i think. it is ,, Definitely Not Approachable  to someone New to these genres  . The vocals are Basically Indecipherable . Speaking of !! the vocalist is Lord Worm !! he got that name by just . just eating worms !!! on stage !!! like onpurpose !!! Kind of real of him I respect it   Anyways  guitar is Fucking awesome in this one and the drums are good too  Honest.yl just Good Song   well written Blah  Blah  Who Cares</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>it may display weirdly, if so I apologize  !!!  forgive me !!! but do tell me what you think about the song?? im interested</p>
                <p>also i'll probably change the song out often while i work on this so . uuhh yeah</p>
                <p>by The way  if  anyone tells me to . i will Continue with making Brief Description"s about  the music i list here . Currently Undecided  as it feels  as I am Talking to Nothing  which does Not make me want to Explain Much   and thus will Stop unless someone Actually tells me they read these (i don.t mind Either way  if nobody reads these I don't have to write More  but if people Do read these i get to write about things I like ! )</p>
