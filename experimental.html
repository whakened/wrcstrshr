                <p><span class="fancy-text">w</span>. I'm w. Formerly worcestershire sauce, even more-so formerly whakened. I came up with the original username maybe around 2016, and it was created by me just.. hitting my keyboard, and then adding vowels so it can be said. In late 2019, I found myself as worcestershire sauce as I had been shuffling through food items as a joke; and then never found anything to replace it. It stuck, and remained until 2024, where I now just call myself w.</p>

                <p>I decided to call myself w as it was very simple; it's not confusing, it's easy to type, and it just looks nice. I never directly decided this, however; I just shortened it as a joke and then it stuck, much like worcestershire sauce had stuck. You'll most often see me still using one of my previous usernames, although if you refer to me by just w, it would be appreciated.</p>

                <p>"What" as in like, what do I do. Not enough room up there for that though. Anyways. I do a lot of shit, but nothing consistently. Primarily I just make games or random programs, of which some can be found on this website. As of recently, music as well, using FamiTracker. I find the constraints there to be entertaining to work with and around. I also just really don't want to have to learn something like FL StuNvm actually I learned it like a week or two ago</p>

                <p>Me? Myself? I don't know. Assuming you don't know me in person, you'll have to figure out most about me by talking to me. I'm typically very open to questions, but I am against publicly detailing myself here. I don't exactly adhere to a single view of me, so to one I may seem an entirely different person to another.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Here's some shit that I do or have done. I was gonna title this section something like "projects, connections, relations" but it was Too Long.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>General Experience And Shit</h3>
            <p>I've worked with programming for at last 6 years, potentially up to 8 years or something. I don't know, I haven't kept track. Unfortunately, I am just as terrible as I was when I began.</p>
            <p>I typically revolve around gamedev, however I find it very difficult to keep my attention on one project for long enough to have something playable. By now I have not made anything in so long that I simply refuse to try again, so I am trying to get past that first before I try anything else.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The NEAT Project</h3>
            <p>Pretty much the only thing I'm known for is ironically one of the things I treat so poorly. If you somehow are here by other means, TNP is a game I made on ROBLOX over 5 years ago by now. I ceased any effective production on it by I believe sometime around 2021, with me not soon after being determined to not dare touch the platform again. Yet still, it is in my possession to the disdain of many. I don't quite get why I'm still supported by TNP after having thoroughly ignored it for so long.</p>
            <p>I've made efforts to return occasionally, with absolutely none being effective whatsoever. Further details on this topic, while I would love to talk about, are not something I believe is worth detailing publicly.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Actual Gamedev</h3>
            <p>I've been working at this for a couple years. I have yet to publicly share really anything I have made due to the fact that most of my work just not really that good. Maybe that will change someday, maybe not.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Random Shit</h3>
            <p>Just completely random shit is something I used to love doing. I used to make shit for the sole purpose of having fun. I used to make games on fucking calculators of all things, I made a shitty program that made HTML documents from a rudimentary command-line GUI using LUA, I even tried making an entire chess engine from scratch. I don't do much of this anymore unfortunately.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>This Website</h3>
            <p>I don't remember why I made this website originally! I just kind of have a website now. Regardless, it has beautifully detailed my progress in a way I could not do so with words.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="inl-b full custom-spacing">
            <p>Trying to or wish to talk with me? Consider The Following .</p>
            <p>I am difficult to speak with sometimes! I kind of suck miserably at understanding things so you Might have to give me a second occasionally.</p>
            <p>Also Please never expect me to message first. You can tell me I'm allowed to, but I still won't. I do not allow myself to do so. No, I do not know why!</p>
            <p>Despite these, I fucking love talking with people!! Doesn't have to be anything important, almost anything will get my attention.</p>
            <p hidden>No Like Seriously Please Talk To Me . I Beg .</p>
