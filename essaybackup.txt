<p>Hello  !!!   i  Type  Kind of like an  Actual Fucking Psychopath.  You . Might have wondered Why i type as such . ??? maybe ??? Perhaps ???</p>
                <p>Anyways   Im . Going to Write this as i would Type Normally  so that you can . Maybe try to  Figure out how    I     ,, felt  while Typing this . Fun Challenge (although Spacing is Not Preserved . Fuck Html Or Whatever )</p>
                <br>
                <p>So To Start Off With . Why do I type like This !?</p>
                <p>i Used to type in a Similar Manner as i do Now , however it was Without Any Real Purpose .  I would not be picky about Capitalization  and punctuation had No meaning regardless of Where it was . Something from 2019 might have looked like :</p>
                <p><span style="color: #aaa;">h;'Ello  thi.s i san e.;xam[ple sente.nce'</span></p>
                <p>while it Looks Somewhat similar to how i type Now ,  it is . Drastically Different . I No Longer interrupt Words as such and i Do not use half of those Characters without Reason anymore .</p>
                <br>
                <p>. Following this , around 2020 or Maybe 2021 , i attached Arbitrary Meanings to Individual Letters . i Do not fully recall these , although i know i would Often use 'h' as a Sigh , 'j' as Filler , and 'r' as Some sort of like . Judgement thing . If that Makes Sense .</p>
                <br>
                <p>and again Later , maybe around 2022 or early 2023 i assigned meanings to strings of random letters . each Row of the keyboard meant something Different . and No i do Not remember what it was . Lost Media ..... Wtf ....</p>
                <br>
                <p>And now , 2024 , we have  Whatever this Bull Shit is . Awesome !!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>so now Onto the Actual Question . What The Fuck does This Shit Mean when I Use It !?</p>
                <p>i will . Do you the favor of Separating these by Category . It Gets Complicated</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Capitalization</h2>
                <p>i believe this is the Least Complicated so i shall Start with This First .</p>
                <p>i Often use Capitalization to provide Emphasis to what i am Saying . if i Capitalize Things In Succession it is to emphasize the Entire string rather than a select Word . i will also capitalize to make Some messages look Funnier , however that is Obviously Very Subjective and not worth Looking Deeply Into .</p>
                <h2>Spacing</h2>
                <p>not the Most Complicated but a Step Up from Prior ,  my Spacing .  Regarding Punctuation , i will Almost Always leave a Space Before and After something regarding punctuation . I find it  Much easier to Read .</p>
                <p> Outside of Punctuation , i will Often Double my Spaces behind words i am Unsure of using , or if I  had to Think for a second to get the word . Typically the More Spaces , the More Unsure I Am or the Longer It Took me to Think of the Word . it Most Often is me being Unsure of the word Used but Not knowing a Better Alternative .</p>
                <h2>Punctuation</h2>
                <p>a Little Bit of a Nightmare , we have . Punctuation . </p>
                <h3>Periods / Full Stops</h3>
                <p>i . use Periods (full stop's ... bri tish) Somewhat Normally , although you May have noticed a few Odd Points in which I had Used Them . this is Likely due to the fact i Often use them as a short Pause before Words , Similar in the way i use Multiple Spaces before Words to Indicate Uncertainty in either The Word Choice or the Sentence being Said .</p>
                <p>If used Before a word or sentence Without having been used to finish a sentence (i.e. ". example") this is likely Easiest interpreted as a text equivalent of an 'um' .</p>
                <h3>Commas</h3>
                <p>for the Most Part i use these As Intended . You may Sometimes see me use them in place of an Ellipsis ( the (...) thing ) and this is Typically for me to show Doubt in what i am Responding to or What I am Saying . Normal Ellipsis are almost Never used ; really just Only if i think it would look Funny .</p>
                <p>Same Conditions if used Before a word or Sentence as the Period .</p>
                <h3>Semicolons</h3>
                <p>i believe i have No special use case for these , however these are only used if i find them Necessary .</p>
                <hr>
                <p>If i am Missing Anything .   Let Me Know . I will Add it here . and if Anything is Too Confusing i will Attempt to simplify it as well . Thanks For Reading  Maybe Now you can Understand Me ,,</p>
